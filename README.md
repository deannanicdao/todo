## Todo
Here we have a simple todo app to practice CRUD with javascript DOM manipulation. You don't **need** to change the HTML but you are able to add ids and data-attributes to the HTML to make life a little easier for yourself. You should delete or comment out the sample items from the \<ul> and the \<select> once you see the layout of what it should look like.

#### CREATE
In the "Add new" section, there is a form to create a new todo item. Once you hit create it should add to your list of items. There will also be a delete button which will be incorporated later.

#### READ
Every time you create/delete/update the items, it should be dynamically rendered on the page with DOM manipulation. There is also the dropdown box (\<select>) which should be updated as well. ie when you create an item it should show up on both sections.

#### DELETE
In the create section you should of added a button to the \<li>. When that button is clicked it should remove that \<li> from the list

#### Update
In the edit section there is that \<section> that should be dynamic with the existing items, once an item is deleted it should be removed from here as well. To edit an item you select one of the \<option> elements, each \<option> has a value attribute which should be the index or id of the item. You can use that to find and edit from your list of items.
